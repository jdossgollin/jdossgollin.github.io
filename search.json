    "text": "I’m James Doss-Gollin, an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University. My research passion lies at the fascinating intersection of climate dynamics, water management, data science, and decision science.\nIn my work, I tackle challenging questions that arise when these fields converge. I’m particularly excited about developing methods to understand and predict spatiotemporally clustered hydroclimate risk. Additionally, I’m keen on finding ways to incorporate uncertain projections into sequential decision problems. Through these efforts, I aim to contribute to the provision of flexible and resilient infrastructure services.\nAs an educator, I have the privilege of teaching courses that equip the next generation with the skills to address our changing world.\nBefore joining Rice CEVE, I had the opportunity to work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Pennsylvania State University and as a PhD student in Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University.\n\n\nFor publications, teaching, and research projects, please see the Doss-Gollin Lab website."
